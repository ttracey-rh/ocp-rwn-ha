# Remote worker nodes HA configuration

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a potential solution to provide application level HA between two nodes in an OpenShift cluster.  Several telco application vendors and customers have expressed interest in this setup to provide highly available services in remote locations.  

## Architecture
TODO: Add arch diagram
This solution will work with either a Hypershift(hosted control plane) + RWN or SNO + worker configuration for the OCP cluster.
